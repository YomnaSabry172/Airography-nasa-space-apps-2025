# High-Level Summary

Air pollution is an invisible killer, contributing to over 4.2 million premature deaths each year. Yet most people only learn about the dangers of exposure after it is too late. **Airography** changes this by forecasting air quality risks before they strike, giving communities the power to act early and save lives.

Our platform integrates NASAâ€™s TEMPO satellite data with ground-based observations from Pandora and OpenAQ, enriched with weather features. These inputs are processed through **XGBoost models**, chosen for their speed, robustness, and interpretability on tabular environmental data. The system validates measurements across multiple sources, ensuring reliability, and predicts pollution levels up to seven days in advance.

What makes Airography different is personalization. Dashboards are tailored to specific user needs: asthma patients receive alerts and medication reminders, farmers gain acid rain warnings, policymakers monitor long-term exposure trends, and industrial workers track toxic gases with reporting tools. Interactive 2D maps and 3D globe views reveal global and local patterns, while historical analysis provides context.

By transforming complex atmospheric science into clear, actionable insights, Airography empowers families, decision-makers, and communities to breathe safer, respond sooner, and build healthier futures.
